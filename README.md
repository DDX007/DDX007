I am an active researcher in machine learning, medical image analysis, fluid dynamics, partial differential equations and their applications. I am particularly interested in exploring the intersection of mathematical modeling, machine learning and natural language processing.

Currently, I'm looking for a Ph.D. position on a well-facilitated platform where I can learn as well as conduct research to examine situations in the real world.

Skills:

Machine Learning: Python
Applied Mathematics: Numerical Methods, PDEs, Optimization, Statistics
Programming: Python, MATLAB, R, C, C++
Tools: Git, LaTeX

Interests:

Machine Learning Security
Software Security
AI for Mathematical Modeling

Let's collaborate!
